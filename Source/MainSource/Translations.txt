HOW TO TRANSLATE UPX SHELL!
--------------------------

-Copy English.lng to file named Lang.lng (where Lang is your language) into UPX Shell directory.
-Translate english strings after = (equal) sign (ATTENTION: do NOT change anything before the = sign, as this may lead to system crash).
-When finished translating run UPX Shell and your language should appear on the dropdown box in Options tab, and make sure that everything is translated.
-When assured that everything looks perfect submit the translated file to mail@iontrooper.com.
-That's it. You can start using UPX Shell in your favourite language.

Hint: for almost all of the items you can add a 'hint'. This is how you do it:
lets say you have this line in .lng file:
MainForm.lblCompressor.Caption=Win32 EXE, DLL compressor
and you want to add a hint which would popup when you move a mouse pointer over it, so you add a new line to that .lng file:
MainForm.lblCompressor.Hint=UPX RULEZ!!!
